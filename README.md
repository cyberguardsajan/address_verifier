# Email Address Verifier

The **Email Address Verifier** is a simple Python program designed to validate the format of an email address.
It checks whether the input email conforms to the standard email format (e.g., `username@domain.com`) using regular expressions.

## Features

- **Email Format Validation:** Ensures the email address follows a valid pattern such as `example@domain.com`.
- **Simple User Input:** Users can input an email address, and the program will inform them whether the format is valid or invalid.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cyberguardsajan/address_verifier.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd email_address_verifier.py
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python email_verifier.py
    ```
2. Enter an email address when prompted:
   - The program will check the format of the email and display whether it is valid or invalid.

## Example Output

```text
Enter an email address to verify: test@example.com
test@example.com is a valid email address.

Enter an email address to verify: invalid-email
invalid-email is an invalid email address.
```
